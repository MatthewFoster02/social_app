# Backend Structure

### UML Diagram (Basic)

![UML](https://github.com/MatthewFoster02/social_app/blob/main/planning/backend/diagrams/UML.png)

The above UML diagram is basic overview of the simple structure of the backend for the application.

The main.py file will contain our [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) app and the methods for starting up and shutting down our connection to the MongoDB python client. It will also bind our two routes to the FastAPI app.

In the CRUD folder, which will handle the transfer of data between the database and the API endpoints there are two separate files. One for users and the other for posts. The users file containing functions adding new users, updating existing users, deleting users, getting a user by ID. The posts file similarly has functions for creating a new post; getting all posts, all posts by user with ID, post by ID; deleting posts.

The functions in the CRUD folder use the models from the model folder to ensure that the data being entered into the database is in the correct format. Containing all the required information to maintain uniformity between instances in each collection, (users and posts).

The routes folder contains two files for the two collections. A users route, for routes relating to CRUD requests on users. Similarly, for posts. It receives the JSON data from the request to the endpoints and transfers it to the CRUD functions which ensure that the data has the correct attributes before adding it to the database, or in the case of a GET request simply returning the data that was requested.

The Authorization file allows for authentication of users while logging in. Contains functions for hashing passwords (required to be done before storing in database), comparing plain password with stored hash, creating and decoding JWT authentication tokens for user sessions.

This was a basic introduction to the contents and structure of the backend folder. The API documentation, automatically generated by FastAPI for the routes mentioned above can be found [here]() ![ACTULLY ADD THIS!!]()
