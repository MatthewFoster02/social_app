# Social Media Application (Shallow Clone)

## [WEBSITE](https://social-media-application-clone.netlify.app/) *(Backend hosted on [Render](https://render.com/))*
This GitHub repository contains the plans and code for a social media clone. The frontend style resembles Twitter, you can find the Adobe Xd design files [here](https://github.com/MatthewFoster02/social_app/blob/main/planning/frontend/FRONTEND.md) and a general structure of the frontend react app. 

The backend is coded in python using the FastAPI library. [This](https://github.com/MatthewFoster02/social_app/blob/main/planning/backend/BACKEND.md) document explains the structure and design of the backend.

### MAJOR FEATURE (GPT ASSISTANCE): When a user wants to create a post they can ask the assistant to create a post for them. The assistant simply takes the input and sends it to the OpenAI API endpoint for Chat Completion.

The other main features are registering for an account, logging in/out, creating a post, commenting on a post, liking a post, deleting a post, viewing and individual post and all its comments, searching for a user's profile, viewing profiles (including your own), and updating your profile.

This application is using the FARM stack. FastApi, React, MongoDB!
